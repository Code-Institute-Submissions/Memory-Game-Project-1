## Testing

### Website Testing

### Code Testing and Bugfixing

- Bugs Documented
    - The game would think that matching colours are not matching and vice versa. 
        - FIX: Line 59 in main.js operator was set to === instead of !==. This simple change fixed the bug.
    - Bootstrap overwriting the color of the game cards 
        - FIX: To fix this I had to change the class name of all game cards from .card to .gamecard. This fixed the issue.

## Deployment

I deployed this website by taking the following steps:

1. Going to github.com and logging in to my account.
2. Choosing the project repository.
3. Opening the settings and scrolling down to "GitHub Pages"
4. Enabling GitHub Pages by selecting the master branch and the root folder.
5. Pressing save.
